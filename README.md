Hi, this library is being re-written ‚Äî please check the `wip` branch, the [examples](example/src/examples) directory, or the  [`TODO.md`](./docs/TODO.md) file for progress ‚ú® (for the old version of the docs, see: [`README-old`](./README-old.md)).

* Support for iOS 15 sheet detents, and iOS 16 custom detents (+ all the related sheet-related customizations and events).
* Typescript re-write for better auto-complete.
* Streamlining the modal-related events, and exposing more events.
* Better iPad support.
* Etc.

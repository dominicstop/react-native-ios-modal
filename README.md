# react-native-ios-modal

## 🚧⚠️ Re-Write in Progress ⚠️🚧

hello, this library is being re-written — please see the [`v2.x`](https://github.com/dominicstop/react-native-ios-modal/tree/v2.x) branch for the older version of this library + it's corresponding documentation.

* Support for iOS 15 sheet detents, and iOS 16 custom detents (+ all the related sheet-related customizations and events).
* Typescript re-write for better auto-complete.
* Streamlining the modal-related events, and exposing more events.
* Better iPad support.
* Etc.
